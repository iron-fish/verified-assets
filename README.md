### Verified Assets
Iron Fish allows user created assets similar to ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. A full list of minted on chain assets can be found for [mainnet](https://explorer.ironfish.network/assets) or [testnet](https://testnet.explorer.ironfish.network/assets). Because anyone can create and mint a new asset and select the name it can be hard for users to know which assets are legitimate. This is what verified asset lists are for.

Asset creators can add verified information about their asset to an asset list which lets users know an asset comes from a legitimate source. This repo is one of those lists maintained by the Iron Fish foundation.
